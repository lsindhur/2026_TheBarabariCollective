//assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

let x = 10; //assigning the value of 10 to x
/* console.log(x+=10); //x = x+10 //x = 10+10; //x=20
console.log(x-=10); //x = x-10 //x = 20-10; //x=10
console.log(x /= 2); //x = x/2 //x = 10/2 ; x=5;
console.log(x %= 1); //x = x%1; x=5%1; x=0
console.log(x *= 5); //x = x*5; x=0*5 //x=0 */

//What’s the difference between a += b and a =+ b?
let a=10 ;
let b=5;

//console.log(a+=b); //15
//console.log(a=+b);//5
